Voter Comments:
 Christey> A Bugtraq posting indicates that the bug has to do with
   "short packets with certain options set," so the description
   should be modified accordingly.
   
   But is this the same as CVE-1999-0052?  That one is related
   to nestea (CVE-1999-0257) and probably the one described in
   BUGTRAQ:19981023 nestea v2 against freebsd 3.0-Release
   The patch for nestea is in ip_input.c around line 750.
   The patches for CVE-1999-0001 are in lines 388&446.  So, 
   CVE-1999-0001 is different from CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052.
   The FreeBSD patch for CVE-1999-0052 is in line 750.
   So, CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052 may be the same, though
   CVE-1999-0052 should be RECAST since this bug affects Linux
   and other OSes besides FreeBSD.
 Frech> XF:teardrop(338)
   This assignment was based solely on references to the CERT advisory.
 Christey> The description for BID:190, which links to CVE-1999-0052 (a
   FreeBSD advisory), notes that the patches provided by FreeBSD in
   CERT:CA-1998-13 suggest a connection between CVE-1999-0001 and
   CVE-1999-0052.  CERT:CA-1998-13 is too vague to be sure without
   further analysis.

   MSKB:Q154174 (CVE-1999-0015) and MSKB:Q179129 (CVE-1999-0104)
   indicate that CVE-1999-0015 was fixed in NT SP3, but
   CVE-1999-0104 was not.  Thus CD:SF-LOC suggests that the

Voter Comments:
 Christey> This should be split into three separate problems based on
   the SNI advisory.  But there's newer information to further
   complicate things.
   
   What do we do about this one?  in 1997 or so, SNI did an
   advisory on this problem.  In early 2000, it was still
   discovered to be present in some Linux systems.  So an 
   SF-DISCOVERY content decision might say that this is a
   long enough time between the two, so this should be recorded
   separately.  But they're the same codebase... so if we keep
   them in the same entry, how do we make sure that this entry
   reflects that some new information has been discovered?
   
   The use of dot notation may help in this regard, to use one
   dot for the original problem as discovered in 1997, and
   another dot for the resurgence of the problem in 2000.
 Baker> We should merge these.
 Christey> Perhaps this should be NAI-19 instead of NAI-20?
   The original Bugtraq post for the SNI advisory suggests SNI-19:
   BUGTRAQ:19971002 SNI-19:BSD lpd vulnerability

   However, archives of "NAI-0020" point to the lpd vuln.
   
   If I recall correctly, some of the NAI advisory numbers got
   switched when NAI acquired SNI.

Voter Comments:
 Christey> DUPE CVE-1999-0418 and CVE-1999-0250?
 Christey> Dan Bernstein, author of Qmail, says that this is not a
   vulnerability in qmail because Unix has built-in resource
   limits that can restrict the size of a qmail process; other
   limits can be specified by the administrator.  See
   http://cr.yp.to/qmail/venema.html
   
   Significant discussion of this issue took place on the qmail
   list.  The fundamental question appears to be whether 
   application software should set its own limits, or rely
   on limits set by the parent operating system (in this case,
   UNIX).  Also, some people said that the only problem was that
   the suggested configuration was not well documented, but this
   was refuted by others.
   
   See the following threads at
   http://www.ornl.gov/its/archives/mailing-lists/qmail/1997/06/threads.html
   "Denial of service (qmail-smtpd)"
   "qmail-dos-2.c, another denial of service"
   "[PATCH] denial of service"
   "just another qmail denial-of-service"
   "the UNIX way"
   "Time for a reality check"
   
   Also see Bugtraq threads on a different vulnerability that
   is related to this topic:
   BUGTRAQ:19990903 Web servers / possible DOS Attack / mime header flooding
   http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/1998_3/0742.html
 Baker> http://cr.yp.to/qmail/venema.html
   Berstein rejects this as a vulnerability, claiming this is a slander campaign by Wietse Venema.
   His page states this is not a qmail problem, rather it is a UNIX problem
   that many apps can consume all available memory, and that the administrator
   is responsible to set limits in the OS, rather than expect applications to
   individually prevent memory exhaustion.  CAN 1999-0250 does appear to
   be a duplicate of this entry, based on the research I have done so far.
   There were two different bugtraq postings, but the second one references
   the first, stating that the new exploit uses perl instead of shell scripting
   to accomplish the same attack/exploit.

 Christey> qmail-dos-1.c, as published by Wietse Venema (CVE-1999-0250)
   in "BUGTRAQ:19970612 Denial of service (qmail-smtpd)", does not
   use any RCPT commands.  Instead, it sends long strings
   of "X" characters.  A followup by "super@UFO.ORG" includes
   an exploit that claims to do the same thing; however, that
   exploit does not send long strings of X characters - it sends
   a large number of RCPT commands.  It appears that super@ufo.org
   followed up to the wrong message.
   
   NOTE: the ufo.org domain was purchased by another party in
   2003, so the current owner is not associated with any
   statements by "super@ufo.org" that were made before 2003.
   
   qmail-dos-2.c, as published by Wietse Venema (CVE-1999-0144)
   in "BUGTRAQ:19970612 qmail-dos-2.c, another denial of service attack"

Voter Comments:
 Meunier> The location of the vulnerability, whether in the Linux kernel or the
   application, is debatable.  Any program making the same (reasonnable)
   assumption is vulnerable, i.e., implements the same vulnerability:
   "Assumption that TCP-three-way handshake is complete after calling Linux
   kernel function accept(), which returns socket after getting SYN.   Result
   is process death by SIGPIPE"
   Moreover, whether it results in DOS (to third parties) depends on the
   process that made the assumption.
   I think that the present entry should be split, one entry for every
   application that implements the vulnerability (really describing threat
   instances, which is what other people think about when we talk about
   vulnerabilities), and one entry for the Linux kernel that allows the
   vulnerability to happen.

Voter Comments:
 Frech> XF:qmail-rcpt
 Christey> DUPE CVE-1999-0418 and CVE-1999-0144?
 Christey> Dan Bernstein, author of Qmail, says that this is not a
   vulnerability in qmail because Unix has built-in resource
   limits that can restrict the size of a qmail process; other
   limits can be specified by the administrator.  See
   http://cr.yp.to/qmail/venema.html
   
   Significant discussion of this issue took place on the qmail
   list.  The fundamental question appears to be whether 
   application software should set its own limits, or rely
   on limits set by the parent operating system (in this case,
   UNIX).  Also, some people said that the only problem was that
   the suggested configuration was not well documented, but this
   was refuted by others.

   See: CVE-1999-0015, CVE-1999-0104, CVE-1999-0257, CVE-1999-0258
   
   Is CVE-1999-0001 the same as CVE-1999-0052?  That one is related
   to nestea (CVE-1999-0257) and probably the one described in
   BUGTRAQ:19981023 nestea v2 against freebsd 3.0-Release
   The patch for nestea is in ip_input.c around line 750.
   The patches for CVE-1999-0001 are in lines 388&446.  So, 
   CVE-1999-0001 is different from CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052.
   The FreeBSD patch for CVE-1999-0052 is in line 750.
   So, CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052 may be the same, though
   CVE-1999-0052 should be RECAST since this bug affects Linux
   and other OSes besides FreeBSD.
   
   Also see BUGTRAQ:19990909 CISCO and nestea.
   
   Finally, note that there is no fundamental difference between
   nestea and nestea2/nestea-v2; they are different ports that
   exploit the same problem.
   
   The original nestea advisory is at
   http://www.technotronic.com/rhino9/advisories/06.htm
   but notice that the suggested fix is in line 375 of
   ip_fragment.c, not ip_input.c.

 Christey> CVE-1999-0287 is probably a duplicate of CVE-1999-0467.  In
   NTBUGTRAQ:19990409 Webcom's CGI Guestbook for Win32 web servers
   Mnemonix says that he had previously reported on a similar
   problem.  Let's refer to the NTBugtraq posting as
   CVE-1999-0467.  We will refer to the "previous report" as
   CVE-1999-0287, which could be found at:
   http://oliver.efri.hr/~crv/security/bugs/NT/httpd41.html
   
   0287 describes an exploit via the "template" hidden variable.
   The exploit describes manually editing the HTML form to
   change the filename to read from the template variable.
   
   The exploit as described in 0467 encodes the template variable
   directly into the URL.  However, hidden variables are also
   encoded into the URL, which would have looked the same to
   the web server regardless of the exploit.  Therefore 0287
   and 0467 are the same.

 Dik> This vulnerability does exist in SunOS 4.x in non default configurations.
   In Solaris 2.x, the vulnerability only applies to files named "cache_binding"
   and not all files ending in .2
   Both releases are not vulnerable in the default configuration (both
   disabllow ypset by default which prevents this problem from occurring)

Voter Comments:
 Wall> Invalid ICMP datagram fragments causes a denial of service in Windows 95 and

   Reference: Q154174.
   Jolt is also known as sPING, ICMP bug, Icenewk, and Ping of Death.
   It is a modified teardrop 2 attack.  
 Frech> XF:nt-ssping

   is exploiting any different flaw than teardrop does.
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
 Baker> Jolt (original) is basically just a fragmented oversized ICMP that
   kills Win boxes ala Ping of Death.
   Teardrop is altering the offset in fragmented tcp packets so that the
   end of subsequent fragments is inside first packet...
   Teardrop 2 is UDP packets, if I remember right.
   Seems like Jolt (original, not jolt 2) is just exploit code that
   creates a ping of death (CVE 1999-0128)
 Levy> I tend to agree with Baker.
 CHANGE> [Armstrong changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]
 Armstrong> This code does not use fragment overlap.  It is simply a large ICMP echo request.
 Christey> See the SCO advisory at:
   http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/advisory.html?id=1411
   which may further clarify the issue.
 LeBlanc> This is a hodge-podge of DoS attacks. Jolt isn't the same
   thing as ping of death - POD was an oversized ICMP packet, Jolt froze
   Linux and Solaris (and I think not NT), IIRC Jolt2 did get NT boxes.
   Teardrop and teardrop2 were related attacks (usually ICMP frag attacks),
   but each of these is a distinct vulnerability, affected a discrete group
   of systems, and should have distinct CVE numbers. CVE entries should be
   precise as to what the problem is.
 Meunier> I agree with Leblanc in that Jolt is multi-faceted.  Jolt has
   characteristics of Ping of Death AND teardrop, but it doesn't do
   either exactly.  Moreover, it sends a truncated IP fragment.  I
   disagree with Armstrong; jolt uses overlapping fragments.  It's not a
   simple ping of death either.  It may be that the author's intent was
   to construct a "super attack" somehow combining elements of other
   vulnerabilities to try to make it more potent.  In any case it
   succeeded in confusing the CVE board :-).
   
   I notice that Jolt uses echo replies (type 0) instead of echo
   requests (to get past firewalls?).  Jolt is peculiar in that it also
   sends numerous overlapping fragments.  The "Pascal Simulator" :-) says
   it sends:
   
   - 172 fragments of length 400 with offset starting at 5120 and
   increasing by about 47 (odd arithmetic of 5120 OR ((n* 380) >> 3)),
   which eventually results in sending fragments inside an already
   covered area once ((n* 380) >> 3) is greater than 5120, which occurs
   when n is reaches 108.  This would look a bit like TearDrop if
   fragments were reassembled on-the-fly.
   
   - 1 fragment such that the total length of all the fragments
   is greater than 65535 (my calculation is 172*380 + 418 = 65778; the
   comment about 65538 must be wrong).  The last packet is size 418
   according to the IP header but the buffer is of size 400.  The sendto
   takes as argument the size of the buffer so a truncated packet is
   sent.
   
   So, I am not sure if the problem is because the last packet
   doesn't extend to the payload it says it has or because the total size
   of all fragments is greater than 65535.  The author says it may take
   more than one sending, so perhaps this has to do with an incorrect
   error handling and recovery.  One would need to experiment and isolate
   each of those characteristics and test them independently.  Inasmuch
   as each of those things is likely a different vulnerability, then I
   agree with Leblanc that this entry should be split.  I'll try that if
   I ever get bored.  Jolt 2 should also have a different entry (see
   below).
   
   Jolt 2 runs in an infinite loop, sending the same fragmented
   IP packet, which can pretend to be "ICMP" or "UDP" data; however this
   is meaningless, as it's just a late fragment of an IP packet.  The
   attack works only as long as packets are sent.  According to
   http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/62170 the packets are
   truncated, and would overflow over the 65535 byte limit, which is
   similar to Jolt.  Note that Jolt does send that much data whereas
   jolt2 doesn't.  Since jolt2 is simpler and narrower than jolt, and it
   has weaker consequences, I believe that it's a different
   vulnerability.
   
   "Jolt 2 vulnerability causes a temporary denial-of-service in
   Windows-type OSes" would be a title for it.

Voter Comments:
 Christey> Is this the same as CVE-1999-0373?  They both have the same
   X-Force reference.
   
   BID:342 suggests that there are two.
   
   http://www.debian.org/security/1999/19990215a suggests
   that there are two.  However, CVE-1999-0373 is written up in
   a fashion that is too general; and both XF:linux-super-bo and
   XF:linux-super-logging-bo refer to CVE-1999-0373.
   CVE-1999-0373 may need to be split.
   
 Frech> From what I can surmise, ISS released the original advisory (attached to
   linux-super-bo), and Sekure SDI expanded on it by releasing another related
   overflow in syslog (which is linux-super-logging-bo).
   
   When I was originally assigning these issues, I placed both XF references
   and the ISS advisory on the -0373 candidate, since there was nothing else
   available. Based on the information above, I'd request that
   XF:linux-super-logging-bo be removed from CVE-1999-0373.
 Christey> Given Andre's feedback, these are different issues.
   CVE-1999-0373 does not need to be split because the ISS
   reference is sufficient to distinguish that CVE from this
   candidate; however, the CVE-1999-0373 description should
   probably be modified slightly.

Voter Comments:
 Christey> Is CVE-1999-0389 a duplicate of CVE-1999-0798?  CVE-1999-0389
   has January 1999 dates associated with it, while CVE-1999-0798
   was reported in late December.
   
   Also, is this the same line of code as CVE-1999-0914?  Both are in
   the netstd package, it could look like a library problem.
   
   However, deep in the changelog in the
   netstd_3.07-7slink.3.diff on Debian, Herbert Xu includes
   the following entry:
   
   +netstd (3.07-7slink.1) frozen; urgency=high
   +
   +  * bootpd:     Applied patch from Redhat as well as a fix for the overflow in
   +                report() (fixes #30675).
   +  * netkit-ftp: Applied patch from RedHat that fixes some obscure overflow

   +
   + -- Herbert Xu <herbert@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Dec 1998 14:36:48 +1100
   
   This tells me that two separate bugs are involved.
   
   Note that Red Hat posted *some* fix for *some* bootp problem
   in June 1998.  See:
   http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/rh42-errata-general.html#bootp
 Frech> XF:debian-netstd-bo
 Christey> Further analysis indicates that this is a duplicate of CVE-1999-0799
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from REJECT to REVIEWING]
 Christey> The fix information for BID:324 suggests that there are two
   overflows, one of which is in handle_request (bootpd.c) and is
   likely related to a file name; but there is another issue in
   report (report.c) which also looks like a straightforward
   overflow, which would suggest that this is not a duplicate of
   CVE-1999-0798 or CVE-1999-0799.
   
   Note: see comments for CVE-1999-0798 which explain how that
   candidate is not related to CVE-1999-0799.

   Since there are 3 separate "executables" with the same
   (or similar) problem, we need to make sure that CD:SF-EXEC
   determines what to do here.  There is evidence that some
   of these .cfm scripts have an "include" file, and if so, 
   then CD:SF-LOC says that we shouldn't make separate entries
   for each of these scripts.  On the other hand, the initial
   L0pht discovery didn't include all 3 of these scripts, and
   as far as I can tell, Allaire had patched the first problem
   before the others were discovered.  So, CD:DISCOVERY-DATE
   may argue that we should split these because the problems
   were discovered and patched at different times.

 Christey> CVE-1999-0287 is probably a duplicate of CVE-1999-0467.  In
   NTBUGTRAQ:19990409 Webcom's CGI Guestbook for Win32 web servers
   Mnemonix says that he had previously reported on a similar
   problem.  Let's refer to the NTBugtraq posting as
   CVE-1999-0467.  We will refer to the "previous report" as
   CVE-1999-0287, which can be found at:
   http://oliver.efri.hr/~crv/security/bugs/NT/httpd41.html
   
   0287 describes an exploit via the "template" hidden variable.
   The exploit describes manually editing the HTML form to
   change the filename to read from the template variable.
   
   The exploit as described in 0467 encodes the template variable
   directly into the URL.  However, hidden variables are also
   encoded into the URL, which would have looked the same to
   the web server regardless of the exploit.  Therefore 0287
   and 0467 are the same.
 Christey> 
   The CD:SF-EXEC content decision also applies here.  We have 2
   programs, wguest.exe and rguest.exe, which appear to have the
   same problem.  CD:SF-EXEC needs to be accepted by the Editorial
   Board before this candidate can be converted into a CVE
   entry.  When finalized, CD:SF-EXEC will decide whether
   this candidate should be split or not.

 Wall> (source: MS:MS99-012)
 Prosser> agree with Andre here.  The Untrusted Scripted paste
   vulnerability was originally addressed in MS98-015 and it is in the file
   upload intrinsic control in which an attacker can paste the name of a file
   on the target's drive in the control and a form submission would then send
   that file from the attacked machine to the remote web site.  This one has
   nothing to do with the clipboard.  What the advisory mentioned here,
   MS99-012, does is replace the MSHTML parsing engine which is supposed to fix
   the original Untrusted Scripted Paste issue and a variant, as well as the
   two Cross-Frame variants and a privacy issue in IMG SRC.  
   The vulnerability that allowed reading of a user's clipboard is the Forms
   2.0 Active X control vulnerability discussed in MS99-01

   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=92488772121313&w=2
   
   Here's the nature of the problem.
   (1) FFingerd allows users to decide not to be fingered,
   printing a message "That user does not want to be fingered"
   (2) If the fingered user does not exist, then FFingerd's
   intended default is to print that the user does not
   want to be fingered; however, the error message has a
   period at the end.
   Thus, ffingerd can allow someone to determine who valid users
   on the server are, *in spite of* the intended functionality of
   ffingerd itself.  Thus this exposure should be viewed in light
   of the intended functionality of the application, as opposed
   to the common usage of the finger protocol in general.
   
   Also, the vendor posted a followup and said that a patch was
   available.  See:

Voter Comments:
 Frech> Guessable falls into the class of CVE-1999-0502, since I can guess a
   default, null, etc. password.
   Suggest changing to something like "has an existing non-default password
   that can be guessed."
   I'm also including default passwords in this entry. 
   In that vein, we show the following references:
   XF:user-password
   XF:passwd-username
   XF:default-unix-sync
   XF:default-unix-4dgifts
   XF:default-unix-bin

 Christey> This candidate is affected by the CD:CF-PASS content decision,
   which determines the appropriate level of abstraction to
   use for password problems.  CD:CF-PASS needs to be accepted
   by the Editorial Board before this candidate can be
   converted into a CVE entry; the final version of CD:CF-PASS
   may require using a different LOA than this candidate is
   currently using.
 CHANGE> [Meunier changed vote from ACCEPT to RECAST]
 Meunier> This relates only to account password technology, so this candidate is
   independent of the operating system, application, web site or other
   application of this technology.  The appropriate (natural) level of
   abstraction is therefore without specifying that it is for UNIX.
   Change the description to "An account has a guessable password other
   than default, null, blank."  This should satisfy Andre's objection.
   
   This Candidate should be merged with any candidate relating to
   account password technology where "Unix" in the original description
   can be replaced by something else.

   Candidate implicitly may refer to relaying settings enabled by default, or
   the bypass/circumvention of relaying. Both interpretations were used in
   assigning this candidate.
 Christey> The intention of this candidate is to cover configurations in
   which the admin has explicitly enabled relaying.  Other cases
   in which the application *intends* to prvent relaying, but
   there is some specific input that bypasses/tricks it, count
   as vulnerabilities (or exposures?) and as such would be
   assigned different numbers.

Voter Comments:
 Northcutt> (Though I sympathize with this one :)
 CHANGE> [Frech changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]
 Frech> Ping is a utility that can be run on demand; ICMP echo is a
   message 
   type. As currently worded, this candidate seems as if an arbitrary
   host 
   is vulnerable because it is capable of running an arbitrary program
   or
   function (in this case, ping/ICMP echo). There are many
   programs/functions that 
   'shouldn't' be on a computer, from a security admin's perspective.
   Even if this
   were a vulnerability, it would be impacted by CD-HIGHCARD.
 Meunier> Every ICMP message type presents a vulnerability or an
   exposure, if access is not controlled.  By that I mean not only those
   in RFC 792, but also those in RFC 1256, 950, and more.  I think that
   the description should be changed to "ICMP messages are acted upon
   without any access control".  ICMP is an error and debugging protocol.
   We complain about vendors leaving testing backdoors in their programs.
   ICMP is the equivalent for TCP/IP.  ICMP should be in the dog house,
   unless you are trying to troubleshoot something.  MTU discovery is
   just a performance tweak -- it's not necessary.  I don't know of any
   ICMP message type that is necessary if the network is functional.
   Limited logging of ICMP messages could be useful, but acting upon them
   and allowing the modification of routing tables, the behavior of the
   TCP/IP stack, etc... without any form of authentication is just crazy.

   13 and 14 (timestamp request and reply) and 17 and 18 (netmask request
   and reply) are acted upon without any access control".  It's a more
   precise and correct language.  I believe that this is a valid CVE
   entry (it's a common source of vulnerabilities or exposures) even
   though I see that the inferred action was "reject".  Knowing the time
   of a host also allows attacks against random number generators that
   are seeded with the current time.  I want to push to have it accepted.

 Northcutt> inappropriate implies there is appropriate.  As a guy who has been

   networks for years I have deep reservations about justiying the existance
   of any fixed cleartext password. For appropriate to exist, some "we" would 
   have to establish some criteria for appropriate passwords.
 Baker> Perhaps this could be re-worded a bit.  The CVE CVE-1999-00582
   specifies "...settings for lockouts".  To remain consistent with the
   other, maybe it should specify "...settings for passwords" I think
   most people would agree that passwords should be at least 8
   characters; contain letters (upper and lowercase), numbers and at
   least one non-alphanumeric; should only be good a limited time 30-90
   days; and should not contain character combinations from user's prior
   2 or 3 passwords.
   Suggested rewrite - 
   A Windows NT account policy does not enforce reasonable minimum

Voter Comments:
 Shostack> Is this a default alias?  Is my .procmailrc an instance of this?
 Christey> It is not entirely clear whether the simple fact that an alias
   pipes into a program should be considered a vulnerability.  It
   all depends on the behavior of that particular program.  This
   is one of a number of configuration-related issues from the
   "draft" CVE that came from vulnerability scanners.  In
   general, when we get to general configuration and "policy,"
   it becomes more difficult to use the current CVE model to
   represent them.  So at the very least, this candidate (and
   similar ones) should be given close consideration and
   discussion before being added to the official CVE list.
   
   Because this candidate is related to general configuration
   issues, and we have not completely determined how to handle
   such issues in CVE, this candidate cannot be promoted to an
   official CVE entry until such issues are resolved.

   Specific registry keys with bad permissions is roughly

 Christey> http://www.quikstore.com/help/pages/Security/security.htm says:
   
   "It is IMPORTANT that during the setup of the QuikStore program, you
   check to make sure that the cgi-bin or executable program directory
   of your web site not be viewable from the outside world. You don't
   want the users to have access to your programs or log files that could
   be stored there!
   
   ...
   
   If you can view or download these files from the browser, someone
   else can too"
   
   So is this a configuration problem?  See the configuration file at
   http://www.quikstore.com/help/pages/Configuration/configparametersfull.htm
   The [DIRECTORY_PATHS] section identifies pathnames and describes how
   pathnames are constructed.  It clearly uses relative pathnames,
   so all data is underneath the base directory!!
   
   If we call this a configuration problem, then maybe this (and
   all other "CGI-data-in-web-tree" configuration problems) should
   be combined.

   Specific registry keys with bad permissions is roughly

 Prosser> (Modify)
   Have a question on this and on the following three candidates as well.  All
   of these are part of the file viewers utilities that allow unauthorized
   files reading, but MSKB Q231368 also mentioned the diagnostics
   program,Winmsdp.exe, as another vulnerable viewer in this same set of
   viewers.  If we are going to split out the seperate viewer tools then
   shouldn't there should be a seperate CAN for Winmsdp.exe also.
 Christey> Mike's question basically touches on the CD:SF-EXEC
   content decision - what do you do when you have the same bug
   in multiple executables?  CD:SF-EXEC needs to be reviewed
   and approved by the Editorial Board before we can decide
   what to do with this candidate.
 Christey> Mark Burnett says that Microsoft's mention of winmsdp.exe in
   MSKB:Q231368 may be an error, and that winmsdp.exe is a
   Microsoft Diagnostics Report Generator which may not even

Voter Comments:
 Stracener> Add Ref: CIAC: J-069
 Frech> XF:sun-libc-lcmessages
 Prosser> BID 268 is an additional reference for this one as it has info on the Sun
   vulnerability.  However, BID 268 also includes AIX in this vulnerability and
   refs APARS issued to fix a vulnerability in various 'nixs with the Natural
   Language Service environmental variables NSLPATH and PATH_LOCALE depending
   on the 'nix, ref CERT CA-97.10, CVE-1999-0041.  However, Georgi Guninski
   reported a BO in AIX with LC_MESSAGES + mount, also refed in BID 268, so it
   is possible the AIX APARs fix an earlier, similar vulnerability to the Sun
   BO in LC_MESSAGES.   This should probably be considered under a different
   CAN.  Any ideas? 
 Christey> Given that the buffer overflows in CVE-1999-0041 are NLSPATH
   and PATH_LOCALE, I'd say that's good evidence that this is not
   the same problem.  But a buffer overflow in libc in
   LC_MESSAGES... We must ask if these are basically the same
   codebase.
   
   ADDREF CIAC:J-069
 Christey> While the description indicates multiple programs, CD:SF-EXEC
   does not apply because the vulnerability was in libc, and
   rcp and ufsrestore were both statically linked against libc.
   Thus CD:SF-LOC applies, and a single candidate is maintained
   because the problem occurred in a library.
 Dik> Sun bug 4240566
 Christey> I'm consulting with Casper Dik and Troy Bollinger to see if
   this should be combined with the AIX buffer overflows for
   LC_MESSAGES; current indications are that they should be
   split.
 Christey> For further consultation, consider this post, though it's
   associated with CVE-1999-0041:
   BUGTRAQ:19970213 Linux NLSPATH buffer overflow

 Dik> the bug has nothing to do with kcms_configure; it's a bug

   vulnerable.  Sun bug 4295834; fixed in Solaris 8.
 Prosser> Okay, I am confused.  Based on Casper's comments and checking
   on the Sun patch site, I found the 4295834 bug(4295834 NETPATH security
   problem in libnsl) fixed in  SunOS 5.4, Patch 101974-37(x86) 101973 (sparc).
   Multiple libnsl vulnerabilities was first reported in an 98 Sun Bulletin

   one.  However, a followup email by Jim Duncan of Cisco does
   acknowledge the problem as discussed in the Bugtraq post:

   It could be that the researcher believed that the problem was

Voter Comments:
 Stracener> The pkg* programs pkgtrans, pkginfo, pkgcat, pkginstall, and pkgparam
   can be used to mount etc/shadow printing attacks as a result of the
   "dacread" permission (cf. /etc/security/tcb/privs). The procedural
   differences between the individual exploits for each of these utilities
   are therefore inconsequential. CVE-1999-0988 should be merged with
   CVE-1999-0828. From the standpoint of maintaining consistency of the
   level of abstraction used in CVE, the co-existence of CANS
   1999-0988/1999-0828 present two choices: either merge 0988 with 0828, or
   split 0828 into 4 distinct candidates, keeping 0988 intact. Due to the
   very small differences (in principle) between the exploits subsumed by
   0828 and 0988 and the shared dacread permissions of the pkg* suite, I
   suggest a merge. Below is a summary of the data upon which my decision
   was based.
   utility         exploit
   --------      ---------------------------------- 
   pkgtrans  --> symlink + dacread permission prob
   pkginfo   --> truss (debugging utility) in conjunction with pkginfio -d
   etc/shadow. In this case, it captures the interaction between
   pkginfo                the shadow file. Once again: dacread.
   pkgcat    --> buffer overflow  + dacread permission prob
   pkginstall -> buffer overflow + dacread permission prob
   pkgparam --> -f etc/shadow (works because of dacread).
 Christey> This is a tough one.  While there are few procedural
   differences, one could view "assignment of an improper
   permission" as a "class" of problems along the lines of
   buffer overflows and the like.  Just like some programs
   were fine until they got turned into CGI scripts, this
   could be an emerging pattern which should be given
   consideration.  Consider the Eyedog and scriptlet.typelib
   ActiveX utilities being marked as safe for scripting
   (CVE-1999-0668 and 0669).
   
   ftp://ftp.sco.com/SSE/security_bulletins/SB-99.28a loosely

   REVIEWING(1) Christey

Voter Comments:
 Christey> The discloser does not provide enough details to fully
   understand what the problem is.  This makes it difficult
   because if Maximizer has a concept of "users" and it is
   designed to allow any user to modify any other user's data,
   then this would not be a vulnerability or exposure, unless
   that "cross-user" capability could be used to violate system
   integrity, data confidentiality, or the like.  There are some
   features of Maximizer 6.0 that, if abused, could allow someone
   to do some bad things.  For example, an attacker could modify
   the email addresses for contacts to redirect sales to
   locations besides the customer.  There's also a capability of
   assigning priorities and alarms, which could be susceptible to
   an "inconvenience attack" at the very least, as well as
   tie-ins to e-commerce capabilities.
   
   The critical question becomes: "how is this data shared" in
   the first place?  If it's through a network share or other
   distribution method besides transferring the complete database
   between sites, then this may be accessible to any attacker who
   can mimic a Maximizer client (if there is such a thing as a
   client), and this could be a vulnerability or exposure
   according to the CVE definition.
   
   However, since the Maximizer functionality is unknown to me
   and not readily apparent from product documentation, it's hard
   to know what to do about this one.

 Christey> (prompted from Pascal Meunier) should this be treated
   as a general design issue with ICMP?  Or is it a specific
   implementation flaw that only affects Reliant?
 Meunier> The description is too narrow and incorrect.  Spoofed ICMP
   redirect messages can be used to setup man-in-the-middle attacks
   instead of a DoS.  There's no reason that this behavior would be
   limited to Windows, as it is specified by the standard.  As I said

   SGI:19961203-02-PX may solve this problem, but the advisory is so
   vague that it is uncertain whether this was fixed or not. addnetpr is
   not specifically named in the advisory, which names netprint, which is
   not specified in the original Bugtraq post. In addition, the date on
   the advisory is one day earlier than that of the Bugtraq post, though
   that could be a difference in time zones. It seems plausible that the
   problem had already been patched (the researcher did say "There *was*

 Frech> It seems as if the BID-4089 assignment on this CAN name may be
   in error.
   BID-4089 (Multiple Vendor SNMP Request Handling Vulnerabilities) is
   already assigned to CVE-2002-0013. Also, this CVE issue seems to have
   nothing to do with SNMP.
 Christey> Agreed, this is the wrong BID.  SecurityFocus has assigned
   BID:643 to CVE-1999-1570, but there's a bit of an
   inconsistency.  BID:643 alludes to Bugtraq posts in 1999
   from Brock Tellier, mentioning overflows in sar via BOTH the
   -o and -f parameters.  However, they also link this issue to
   SCO advisory 99.17, although the advisory itself is too vague
   to *really* know what vulns they fixed.  And now the link
   to a potentially more detailed document (sse037.ltr)
   is broken.  So we don't have any independent reason for
   knowing whether SCO 99.17 (a) addresses any "sar"
   vulnerabilities, and (b) even if it does, whether it addresses
   *both* the -o and -f arguments originally claimed by Tellier.
   Finally, it seems rather curious that CSSA-2002-SCO.17
   talks about a -o overflow but does not mention -f.
   Sounds like an email to the security people at SCO
   is in order...
   
   OK.  Having consulted with SCO (who responded quickly), I
   looked even further into this issue.  There is now sufficient
   evidence that the -f overflow was fixed in 1999.  This
   means that a separate candidate should be created (by
   CD:SF-LOC), so the -f overflow is now covered by
   CVE-1999-1571.

 Dik> chkperm runs set-uid bin, so initially the access granted
   will be user bin, not root.  (Though bin access can easily be leveraged
   to root access, less so in Solaris 8+)
   Also, there is reason to believe this bug is not exploitable; the buffer
   overflown is declared in the stack in main(); yet, the program never
   returns from main() but calls exit instead so any damage to return addresses
   is never noticed.

According to Tripp (bugtraq), the audio server doesn't run on a machine without Audio Hardware (logical).  So one has to assume from the bulletin that any 9000 with audio hardware that is running a 10.x or 11.x version of OS with either the 98 or 99 version of Aserver loaded will be vulnerable to either the exploit in CVE-1999-0005(the 98 version of Aserver) or CVE-2000-0078 (the 99 version)and should take appropriate action.  No patches out from HP as of 10/2/2000 so either remove the program or tighten the permissions considerably.

Voter Comments:
 Cole> I would combine all of these shopping cart applications into one listing, 
   since they all have the same vulnerability being able to modify sensitive 
   purchase information via hidden form fields.  My concern is in cases like 
   this we used over 10 entries for basically the same vulnerability.  I could 
   think of cases were there could be 20+ applications with the same 
   vulnerability and in my opinion it could start to weaken the value of CVE 
   where there are 30 entries all referring to the same thing.  It is almost 
   like we are playing the vendor game where more is better.  I think we 
   should go after the quality over quantity aspect.
 Christey> I disagree with Eric here.  This vulnerability is a "type" of
   problem in the same way that a buffer overflow is a "type" of
   problem.  While the shopping cart application bugs were
   proposed mostly at the same time, they are all by different
   vendors.
   
   The raw numbers of applications with this problem can make it
   appear that CVE is artificially inflating the number of
   entries.   However, content decisions such as CD:SF-LOC
   (different lines of code) dictate that these should be
   separated.  It's not a "numbers game" but rather a principled
   and consistent approach to resolving problems with
   selecting a level of abstraction.

   The real problem seems to be with the Windows API call, not the Serv-U FTP
   app. As the "Windows Api SHGetPathFromIDList Buffer Overflow" reference
   states, [The bug can] "cause whatever handles the shortcuts to crash."
   As a suggestion, rephrase the description from Windows's context, and state
   that the Serv-U FTP server is an example of an app that exhibits this
   problem.
 Wall> Comment:  the original UssrLabs advisory does mention the SHGetPathFromIDList
   buffer overflow in a Windows API and that Serv-U FTP uses this API to cause the
   problem.  The problem does not exist on Windows 2000.  The solution seems to be

   **********************************************************
 Ziese> 
   I suggest we I'd like to suggest that we consider not tying
   specifically to a DDOS tool.  Instead, since we are at at higher
   abstraction level, that we make the class include those master/slave
   tool combinations that are used for malicious purposes (i.e. DDOS,
   data exfiltration, or whatever the appropriate classes of effect are).
   
   My concern is that (1) we treat all distributed attacks at the same
   abstract level; not just the DDOS ones.  Second, if it is at a higher
   abstraction level then it seems right to unlimit it (by including
   master/slave combinations in general; not just the DDOS asect).
 Meunier> I think that trinoo etc... are very similar to smurf attacks
   (CVE-1999-0513 ) in the sense that a third party allows itself to be
   used.  Also, there is an  obvious solution that can only be done by
   that third party.
   
   As for the CVE entry, I am considering whether the common entry point
   could be reduced to "egress filtering has not been implemented or has
   been disabled, allowing the sending of spoofed IP packets".
   Incidentally, this would prevent the use of decoys in port scans,
   etc...  This single CVE entry would be very powerful. We could use
   the dot notation to list the DDoS tools and attacks that rely on the
   absence of egress filtering based on the argument that if you have
   egress filtering, nobody will bother to put or use DDoS tools on your
   computers.
   
   The weakness of this is that one could in theory still use DDoS tools
   even if you have egress filtering -- only they will be one shot guns,
   almost completely eliminating their appeal and effectiveness.  One
   use, and they will be blocked, tracked down and destroyed
   efficiently.
   
   Pascal
   
   P.S.: I am attracted by the idea of starting an internet (fire)wall
   of shame, for people who haven't implemented egress filtering.  It
   worked pretty well against sites allowing themselves to be used for
   smurf attacks (http://www.powertech.no/smurf/).  Why not use the same
   strategy for egress filtering?  Of course it's hard to know who is
   the source of IP spoofed  packets.  However the consistent detection
   of crud originating from a server is a sure sign that they haven't
   implemented egress filtering.  For example (my first candidate to
   this wall of shame), this weekend the Linux suse ftp server sent many
   packets with an illegal ip address as source, one reserved for local
   area networks, upon making an ftp connection (it may still be doing
   it, I haven't checked since -- the suse ftp admin mentioned that they
   were aware of it).  It was easy to figure out it was them by
   repeating the ftp connections and observing the 100% reproducibility
   and time correlation of the extraneous packets.  In addition, the
   suse servers kept sending me crud for *hours* after a failed attempt
   to download their PPC beta.
   
   The cost of egress filtering is easily justified.  The argument is
   similar to those relating to pollution, excepted that people don't
   try to break into your car if you have removed the catalytic
   converter.
 Bishop> I need to think about the exact meaning of MP. I suspect I
   will agree with the classification, on an operational basis
   (meaning I may want to revisit it), but I want to think on it
   some more.
 Blake> I don't agree with Pascal that this is a filtering problem analogous to
   smurf.  Rootkit is a better analogy.  The DDoS software doesn't exploit
   any unique vulnerability directly.  It's presence is entirely predicated
   on the existence of at least one other, easily exploited vulnerability.
   >From the perspective of the system owner, this is just one of several
   backdoors that could be installed.  Seems to me that the presence of a
   known backdoor package should be considered a vulnerability (or at least
   an exposure).
   
   I'm really torn on whether or not to split them out, though.  My
   inclination is to group master and slave by package; i.e., trinoo
   master/slave, tfn master/slave, etc.
   
 Wall> 
   Just to be consistent, you may add Trinoo (trin00) and does it matter
   if it is Tribal or Tribe?  The original internal c program says Tribe Flood
   Network.
 Meunier> What they have in common is the use of an amplification mechanism.
   They are broadcasting (multicasting) to a (virtual private) network,
   which then amplifies the messages.  In both cases, the amplification
   is done by the third party victim hosts.  The difference is just that
   the network is virtual instead of physical.
   
   
   Scott, you are assuming that the people who have the tools installed
   are unwilling.  Let's say theoretically speaking that there is an
   underground hacker group (or student association) who is hooked up to
   DSL lines (like in university residences) and who thinks that it
   would be "cool" to form an "army".  How about a popular civil
   movement protesting something, like the WTO last summer?  I think
   some people would voluntarily "enlist" their computers in a cause
   that would use DDoS attacks.  The rootkit analogy does not hold, yet
   the DDoS attacks could be just as effective.  However, if the
   university or ISPs implemented egress filtering, the DDoS attacks
   could be easily stopped because the people could be held accountable.
   The crux of the matter is the anonymity provided by IP spoofing.
   
   You are correct that in most cases, having a DDoS tool installed on
   your system is an exposure like rootkit.  Maybe that deserves a CVE
   entry.  However, I think that does not capture the nature of the
   DDoS, and that an entry about egress filtering is of utmost
   importance because it patches a fundamental vulnerability of IPv4.
 Blake> Excellent response, Pascal, thanks.  I hadn't thought of people
   volunteering, but that's certainly a plausible scenario.  Part of my
   motivation/thinking was a desire to stay away from making this into only
   yet another use for spoofed IP packets.  I wholeheartedly agree that
   egress filtering essential, but am reluctant to single out the recent DDoS
   events as the reason for it.
   
   I'd prefer to split out egress filtering as a seperate CVE entry (on the
   theory that not using egress filtering constitutes an exposure -- at least
   to liability), rather than tying it to these entries.
 Levy> I agree with Scott for no other reason that there needs to be a CVE
   ID so that IDS systems can report this things.
   
   Are we going to start handing out CVE ids for low level design faults?
   E.g. lack of encryption at the IPv4 packet level? lack of resource
   allocation protocols? the used of DES instead of Triple DES? etc
 Shostack> Both excellent points, however, I'd like to add that even if people
   volunteer to host the tools, Trinoo and company allow the controlling
   attacker to hide activities, which counts as an exposure under
   http://cve.mitre.org/About_CVE/About/definition.html
 Cole> Even with all of the debate i accept this one.
 Christey> With respect to inclusion of design flaws in CVE, review
   http://cve.mitre.org/Board_Sponsors/archives/msg00602.html
   
   Other design flaws that have already been added to CVE
   include Smurf (CVE-1999-0513), Fraggle (CVE-1999-0514)
   and TCP sequence number prediction (CVE-1999-0077), although
   this last one may need to be RECAST to a lower level of
   abstraction.
 CHANGE> [Meunier changed vote from REVIEWING to RECAST]
 Meunier> In the sense that this is like a rootkit, then it is a
   duplicate of CVE-1999-0660, "A hacker utility or Trojan Horse is
   installed on a system, e.g. NetBus, Back Orifice, Rootkit, etc..."
   
   It should be recast as CVE-1999-0660.1 DDoS tools
   Other dot notations could indicate different effects of the tools.
 Dik> There doesn't seem to be much to add to the
   discussion.
 Baker> Concur that this is a hacker utility, and should be recast and merged with other backdoor programs that allow a hacker to control the activities of the system.

 Christey> To confirm Andre's question, this is being treated as
   different from CVE-2000-0092, based largely on the fact
   that the exploit is different.  I believe there was
   another reason for keeping these distinct, but that
   "deeper analysis" was not recorded :-(  While it's possible
   that this is the same bug from some common version of make,
   in the absence of other information we should probably
   keep these two split.

   And Debian make:
   http://security.debian.org/dists/slink/updates/source/make_3.77-5slink.diff.gz
   
   OK... now that I've hurt my brain looking at the code, while
   there are major differences in the surrounding code,
   ultimately both FreeBSD and Debian create an "outfile" file
   descriptor for the temporary file, within main() in main.c.
   In addition, child_execute_job() in job.c uses an outfile
   variable - for both sources.
   
   Perhaps FreeBSD reported the -j problem without seeing that it
   could come in from stdin as well, and/or Debian/etc. didn't realize
   that it was exploitable from job control, or maybe a combination of
   the two.  Regardless, the two problems are the same.

 Christey> In a followup to Bugtraq, Juan Carlos Cuartango makes some
   clarifications, specifically that the code that is executed
   *must* be signed by Microsoft.
   
   See BUGTRAQ:20000222 MS signed softwrare privileges
   
   Microsoft sends some followups, including a statement that it
   will include notification.
   
   The question is, does this belong in CVE?  There is no known
   means of exploitation; on the other hand, it is related
   to privacy concerns.  Several posts to the Bugtraq list
   indicate that some people believe that unprompted installation
   is a significant concern.

 Christey> According to Scott Culp, this can only be reproduced if the
   SQL server is running in an unsafe mode that is not
   recommended by Microsoft: "To securely use SQL Server,
   Microsoft recommends using Windows Integrated Security. In
   Windows Integrated Security mode passwords are never stored,
   as your Windows Domain sign-on is used as the security
   identifier to the database server."
   
   We still must consider approving this candidate, however, as a
   user configuration error instead of a software flaw.
   CD:DESIGN-WEAK-ENCRYPTION applies in this case, so if we
   decide to include configuration problems in which a user
   intentionally selects weak encryption, then we might still
   approve this candidate.

Voter Comments:
 Frech> Violation of fundamentum divisionis (that is, it's more than one issue) and
   a potential nitpick:
   - windmail-fileread: allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files
   - windmail-pipe-command: execute commands via shell metacharacters
   - The conjunction 'or' should be 'and', if you decide to stick with one CAN.
 Christey> As Andre basically said without naming content decisions,
   CD:SF-LOC says this should be split.
   
   HOWEVER - the author of the product says that WindMail isn't
   supposed to be a CGI script, and says that the pipe 
   character problem is not related to Geocel.  So should CVE
   record when someone runs a program that wasn't intended to
   be a CGI?  There may be a level of abstraction issue here.
   Note that Perl and shell interpreters in CGI-BIN are 
   already mentioned in CVE-1999-0509.  If we want to include
   "using a program that wasn't designed to be a CGI" as a
   problem, we should have a separate candidate.
   
   See the author's comments at:
   http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/archive.pike?list=1&msg=3.0.5.32.20000331114325.013af680@mailhost.geocel.com
   
   which also claims that the original announcer hasn't provided
   any more details after the author was unable to reproduce the
   problem.
 CHANGE> [Magdych changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]
 Magdych> After reviewing the author's comments, I'm inclined to think that this is more of a misconfiguration than a vulnerability.

   In description, passowrd should be password.
 Cox> The "execute arbitrary commands" part is a seperate vulnerability,
   already assigned CVE-2000-0322.  The package was designed to have no
   password on installation, so "backdoor" does not apply.  When users
   install Piranha they are expected to add a password to the web
   administration GUI, it's a documented part of the procedure.  "The web
   GUI for the Linux Virtual Server (LVS) software in the Red Hat Linux
   Piranha package installs with a default password" is accurate if it
   qualifies as an exposure.

   Every reference I pull up shows the product's name as ICRADIUS. See
   http://mysql.eunet.fi/Downloads/Contrib/icradius.README
 Christey> In a followup, Alan DeKok (aland@FREERADIUS.ORG) says that
   this could occur in other RADIUS servers also; however, the
   bug could only be exploited if someone has altered the
   configuration file, which shouldn't normally be modifiable
   by anyone else.
   
   So, this should be REJECTed since the bug doesn't directly give
   anyone else any additional privileges or access.
 Christey> Alan DeKok <aland@FREERADIUS.ORG> says it applies to other RADIUS
   programs also, *however* since it needs a valid username, only
   the RADIUS owner can exploit it by changing the config file.  But
   if the config file can be written by others - well, that's still
   a potential risk, but you've probably got bigger problems then.
   - http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=95671883515060&w=2
   Look at ChangeLog at ftp://ftp.cheapnet.net/pub/icradius/ChangeLog
   
   Possible confirmation in 0.15: "sql_getvpdata now dynamically
   allocates buffer sizes for sql queries to avoid over runs"
   
   But that's a bit general.
   
   Alan Kok said that Cistron and other RADIUS servers were affected; the
   ICRADIUS changelog says to check the Cistron logs for other possible
   bug fixes, since ICRADIUS uses Cistron codebase.  Go back to
   freeradius.org and find link to Cistron at
   http://www.miquels.cistron.nl/radius/
   
   Cistron changelog at http://www.miquels.cistron.nl/radius/ChangeLog It
   has different version numbers - go back to ICRADIUS changelog to find
   rought equivalents.  ICRADIUS 0.15 uses Cistron 1.6.3 patches, so
   start from there.
   
   No apparent problems in 1.6.3 or 1.6.4, but 1.6.1 says: "Fix all
   strcpy(), strcat(), sprintf() and sccanf() calls for buffer
   overflows."  So perhaps the problem was fixed then?  Or maybe the
   vulnerable sscanf() call was missed and/or disregarded because it was
   believed that the hostname could be trusted since it came from a
   well-controlled configuration file?

   (CVE-2000-0323) a variant of the VBA Shell problem (this
   CAN).  In addition, CVE-2000-0323 does *not* appear in Jet

 LeBlanc> The poster re-discovered a vulnerability we patched two years
   ago, in
   http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms98-008.asp
   Microsoft posted a response to BugTraq when this one went
   public, and reminded them that we'd already patched it.
   
   BTW, I think we want to try and pay attention to follow-ups to
   these threads in order to minimize noise in the process.
 Christey> Based on David's comments, this is covered by CVE-1999-0002.
   However, that candidate may wind up being SPLIT, so I will
   keep this one around for the moment.
   
   With respect to watching followups, we are relying quite
   a bit on other data feeds instead of doing our own reviews
   of all the different data sources.  The data feeds may report
   these problems as new before corrections are posted.
   Followups do often lend additional information to the
   candidates, and as is the case with this one, we will
   often catch the discrepancy before the candidate becomes an
   official entry, whether by MITRE's own analysis or by that
   of other Board members.

 LeBlanc> This is not a vulnerability.  It is essentially an advisory on best
   practices. Also, the description is extremely inaccurate. If I weren't
   intimately familiar with the issue, I would not be able to understand it
   from this. Syskey, when applied at lower levels, has well-documented
   limitations.

   Also, the home page at http://bb4.com has it referring to

 Christey> Appears to be the same as, or similar to, CVE-2000-0011, which was
   also discovered by USSR.  Comments on the AnalogX web site are
   decidedly sparse.  In CVE-2000-0011, USSR only claims that
   the vendor was informed, so is this still the same problem?

 Levy> There was plenty of people that could not reproduce the problem although
   some did. More research (as in actual testing) is probably required.
 LeBlanc> This entry does not specify which versions of Outloook are vulnerable, nor
   is that clear from the BUGTRAQ record. It is much too broad to say just
   "Outlook" when it is definately not all versions of Outlook. The problem
   appears confined to some version of Outlook 97, and if I recall correctly,
   there has been a patch for this for quite some time.

   CVE-2000-0545 seems to be a dupe of CVE-1999-0125 (Buffer overflow in SGI
   IRIX mailx program) since they both allow 'mail' group privileges. There was
   no exploit for SGI's vuln to compare.
 Christey> Since we are taking a split-by-default approach when
   there are insufficient details, we should keep this
   separate from CVE-1999-0125.  The difference in the
   time of discovery is also a factor, even if these wind
   up being the same problem.  However, there just aren't
   enough details to be sure if this is the same problem or not.
 Christey> On June 25, 1998, a buffer overflow in mailx via the HOME
   environmental variable was posted at:
   BUGTRAQ:19980625 security hole in mailx
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=90221103125955&w=2
   
   This affected multiple OSes.
   
   SGI:19980605-01-PX (CVE-1999-0125) was published on September
   29, 1998; while the advisory is short on details, it does
   mention a buffer overflow.
   
   So, there's enough distinction here (time and what gets
   exploited) to say that these should remain split; but
   CVE-1999-0125 likely needs to be RECAST to mention other
   affected OSes.

 Levy> What do others think? Should this be a vuln? I can see the argument
   that some features are simply not available unless you use the maximum
   security settings.
 Christey> At the very least, this needs to be modified to state that
   this problem/concern applies to high ports in general, not
   just Back orifice.
   
   The Bugtraq poster claims that BlackICE "shuts down" the port, 
   but only *after* some initial traffic "leaks" out.  This may
   be by design, but it does mean that there is a small window
   of opportunity in which BlackICE may not work "as
   advertised," even at lower security settings.

   It performs just as any other "firewall" or IDS product can be configured to
   allow traffic without notifying the user. You can adjust settings on
   any product that allow traffic that other people or organizations would
   find unacceptable.  So, as long as it is reflected that this is more of
   a configuration that allows such traffic as opposed to a defective
   or improperly functioning software issue, I don't have a problem with
   it.

 Christey> In an email to issforum@iss.net on September 7, 2000, ISS says
   that Network Sensor 3.2.2 is affected by SYN flooding, but
   RealSecure 5.0 is not affected by Syn flooding.  In addition,
   they could not find conclusive evidence that RS 3.2.2 or 5.0
   was affected by IP fragmentation.  This seems to indicate
   that there are 2 *possible* problems: syn flooding (acknowledged
   by ISS) and fragmentation (unconfirmed).  Perhaps this
   candidate needs to be split, or its description should be
   rewritten to separate the 2 reported problems.

Vulnerabilities in IIS 4.0 and 5.0 do not properly protect against
cross-site scripting (CSS) attacks.  They allow a malicious web site
operator to embed scripts in a link to a trusted site, which are

client then executes those scripts in the same context as the trusted
site, aka the "IIS Cross-Site Scripting" vulnerabilities.

Various TCP/IP stacks and network applications allow remote attackers
to cause a denial of service by flooding a target host with TCP
connection attempts and completing the TCP/IP handshake without
maintaining the connection state on the attacker host, aka the
"NAPTHA" class of vulnerabilities.  NOTE: this candidate may change
significantly as the security community discusses the technical
nature of NAPTHA and learns more about the affected applications.
This candidate is at a higher level of abstraction than is typical for
CVE.

Cross site scripting vulnerabilities in Apache 1.3.0 through 1.3.11
allow remote attackers to execute script as other web site visitors
via (1) the printenv CGI (printenv.pl), which does not encode its
output, (2) pages generated by the ap_send_error_response function
such as a default 404, which does not add an explicit charset, or (3)
various messages that are generated by certain Apache modules or core
code.  NOTE: the printenv issue might still exist for web browsers
that can render text/plain content types as HTML, such as Internet
Explorer, but CVE regards this as a design limitation of those
browsers, not Apache.  The printenv.pl/acuparam vector, discloser on
20070724, is one such variant.

The default configuration for the domain name resolver for Microsoft
Windows 98, NT 4.0, 2000, and XP sets the QueryIpMatching parameter to
0, which causes Windows to accept DNS updates from hosts that it did
not query, which allows remote attackers to poison the DNS cache.

 Christey> Vendor fixed this problem between 1.4.22 and 1.5.5, based
   on a source code comparison.
   CD:SF-LOC says that bugs of the same type, that appear in
   different versions, must be SPLIT.  Therefore this should
   stay separate from CVE-2001-0028.
   
   Change MISC to CONFIRM.  The comments for version 1.5.4
   say "more sprintf/strncpy fixes" and that's the type of
   changes that were made in lib.c, the code that was listed
   in the Bugtraq post for this CAN.

 Christey> In a post to Bugtraq, Joel Moses notes that this is a
   duplicate of CVE-2000-0756:
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=98322714210100&w=2
   
   As of this writing, it is not certain which candidate
   should be preferred: the candidate that has been publicly
   known longer (i.e. CVE-2000-0756), or the more "official"
   candidate, which has probably been publicized more (i.e.
   CVE-2001-0145).
 Balinsky> It seems that this is a more specific case of
   CVE-2000-0756. The reference for 2000-0756 states that there is a
   buffer overflow in the birthday AND the e-mail field, as well as other
   suspected fields. As this current candidate only addresses the
   birthday field, it seems that there are likely different lines of code
   involved.
   Microsoft is not specific about what specifically the patch
   addresses. It is possible that the other overflows in 2000-0756 are
   still vulnerable and that the @stake group just didn't bother to test
   them.
   We will not know the answer until someone retests those other
   fields to see if they are still vulnerable.
   If they are, then 2000-0756 might deserve being split up.

   Not only is this two applications, but it is fixed by two patches.
   Quoting Microsoft:
   Because the flaw occurs in two different code modules, one of which installs
   as part of IIS 5.0 and both of which install as part of Exchange 2000, it is
   important for Exchange 2000 administrators to install both the IIS and
   Exchange patches below. 
   Also, in the description, avoid using an apostrophe on "URLs" when it is
   simply plural and not possessive (aka the "grocer's apostrophe").

Voter Comments:
 Bishop> Sounds like Microsoft just confirmed it!
 Christey> The description should make the point that the original files
   are in plaintext.
 LeBlanc> The preconditions needed to obtain the clear-text backup file
   are that the user must be able to read the raw disk. Only administrators
   or those with physical access can read the raw disk. An admin could
   alter the operating system such that anything a user did would be
   available, even EFS information (since the admin can cause processes to
   run as any user who is logged on currently). Thus even if this issue
   were not present, the same set of preconditions would lead to access to
   the same information. In the case of physical access, scrubbing the disk
   should be viewed only as raising the bar - information can be recovered
   even from overwritten sectors. Additionally, coverage of a file might
   not be complete - in the case where a file is truncated, then encrypted,
   there could be sectors with file information that the operating system
   would have no knowledge of at the time the encryption occurred, and
   there is no practical way to wipe these. Considering all the realities
   of the situation, the only real-world solution is to create files you'd
   like encrypted in a directory marked for encryption.

Appears from ref that this problem has been in every version since the 2.40 problem reported Oct 1999 (CVE 1999-0950).  Just managed to change the code so it requires more characters to overflow the buffer.

 Christey> (prompted from Pascal Meunier) should this be treated

   implementation flaw that only affects Reliant?
 Meunier> It seems obvious that if one sets the MTU to just one byte
   above the size of a IP header (let's say 21 bytes), data transmission
   is not going to go anywhere fast, as the overhead will be 20 times the
   payload...  As I said for another candidate, ICMP messages should not
   be acted upon without access control.  I'm not sure that references to
   UNIX should be kept.  It seems that this should work with any OS.  It
   would be nasty if some OSes accepted an MTU of 20, as you could not
   transmit any IP data.

   Microsoft identifies two separate vulnerabilities that are extremely
   similar, but the security bulletin states that "The two
   vulnerabilities differ primarily in the way they exploit the
   underlying problem regarding named pipe creation."  So, it may be
   necessary to merge CVE-2001-0350 with CVE-2001-0349.

 Christey> The Bugtraq poster didn't provide many details, but said that
   the vendor was out of business.  It's possible that this ILMI
   community string has no relationship with the Cisco ILMI
   problem, in which case this should remain a separate CAN.
 Christey> Further research suggests that ILMI is a standard

   The "world-readable" core dump problem does not exist in
   Solaris 8 and other Solaris releases which have been patched
   to include the "coreadm" command and possibly earlier (many release
   have been patched to avoid core dumps in more situations and
   always make them mode 0600)
   
   Solaris 8 was the first release to contain coreadm initially
   (backported and include in 2.6 & 7)

 Frech> XF:savant-get-bo(4901)
 Christey> Should CVE-2002-0099 and/or CVE-2001-0433 be MERGED with
   CVE-2000-0641?  All describe slightly different overflows
   that, perhaps, should be merged according to CD:SF-LOC.
   It depends on which versions are affected, which would require
   some vendor acknowledgement or consultation.
   
   A vague changelog for version 3.1 at
   http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=75333 says
   "security fixes" but it's not clear *which* security fixes
   were made.
   
   The description for CVE-2000-0641 is slightly incorrect.  The
   exploit is clearly due to a large number of headers, not
   arguments to the GET request itself.  So, CVE-2000-0641
   clearly overlaps with CVE-2001-0433.
   
   The exploit for CVE-2001-0433 also doesn't really have
   anything to do with a "cgi-test.pl" program (which isn't in
   the distribution).  The discloser simply used that as an
   example program of a long request.

 Williams> kdesu is part of kdelibs package.  since entire kdelibs package must be upgraded, and since kdelibs (rather than kdesu) is referenced in most advisories related to this issue, we might want to reference kdelibs in this CAN.
 Frech> XF:kdelibs-kdesu-insecure-tmpfile(6856)
 Christey> Agree with Ken Williams.  The CVE descriptions in general
   should capture all "reasonable" keywords under which
   someone may know the vulnerability.
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
 Christey> It's possible that this is the same vulnerability as CVE-2001-0178,
   but the description is written so differently from the others, that
   it's hard to be sure.  In addition, Mandrake released a separate
   advisory for CVE-2001-0178.

Voter Comments:
 Christey> There is some overlap between CVE-2001-0551 and CVE-2001-0772.
   CVE-2001-0551 describes a specific vulnerability in
   dtprintinfo.  HP acknowledges CVE-2001-0551 by stating
   that the problem is fixed in HP:HPSBUX0105-151, which
   is CVE-2001-0772.  But CVE-2001-0772 is a vague advisory
   that identifies other vulnerabilities (and vulnerability
   types) besides CVE-2001-0551.  Perhaps CVE-2001-0772 should
   be RECAST to "remove" the reference to dtprintinfo and
   leave the other vague descriptions.  CVE-2001-0772 and
   CVE-2001-0551 are very good examples of the problems that
   CVE faces in being consistent with respect to the level of
   abstraction, as documented in the CD:SF-CODEBASE, CD:SF-LOC,
   and CD:VAGUE content decisions.
 Baker> We should rewrite the candidate entry CVE-2001-0772 to address the other issues, and point the dtprintinfo issue to this entry.

The SSH protocols 1 and 2 (aka SSH-2) as implemented in OpenSSH and
other packages have various weaknesses which can allow a remote
attacker to obtain the following information via sniffing: (1)
password lengths or ranges of lengths, which simplifies brute force
password guessing, (2) whether RSA or DSA authentication is being
used, (3) the number of authorized_keys in RSA authentication, or (4)
the lengths of shell commands.

   This is the site for downloading from Deerfield, the parent company.
   The release notes on the web site only apply to version 4.0 and higher.
   If you download the 3.5.6 version, you can then install the software,
   which will also install the release notes, named RelNotes.txt, in the
   docs sub-directory.  Inside this file is a vendor confirmation
   of sorts, at least close enough for me....

   Possible duplicate of CVE-2000-0083: HP asecure creates the
   Audio Security File audio.sec with insecure permissions, which allows
   local users to cause a denial of service or gain additional
   privileges.
 Williams> Frech - this is not a dupe of CVE-2000-0083.
 Christey> While this advisory is vaguely worded, the fact that HP did an
   advisory for the other asecure problem (now CVE-2000-0083)
   indicates at the very least that this problem occurs in
   a different version than CVE-2000-0083, so CD:SF-LOC
   suggests a SPLIT.  However, the HP advisory says "10.X"
   and "11.X" are affected, so who knows what versions they

 Baker> I would argue that a browser executing a script when it shouldn't is still a vulnerability.  If it is supposed to be a non-scriptable file type, and that fails, resulting in a script being executed without the user's knowledge, then it is a problem, and thus should be included as a vulnerability.  I vote this should be accepted, and if Microsoft acknowledges this in their follow up, then you have vendor acknowledgement of the problem as well.

Sendmail before 8.12.1 does not properly drop privileges when the -C
option is used to load custom configuration files, which allows local
users to gain privileges via malformed arguments in the configuration
file whose names contain characters with the high bit set, such as (1)
macro names that are one character long, (2) a variable setting which
is processed by the setoption function, or (3) a Modifiers setting
which is processed by the getmodifiers function.

 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
 Christey> There is evidence that this problem was confirmed by Trend,
   but there are some inconsistencies.
   MISC:http://solutionbank.antivirus.com/solutions/solutionDetail.asp?solutionID=9682
   Note, however, that the date of the patch description at
   MISC:http://solutionfile.trendmicro.com/SolutionFile/9682/en/ReadMe-BufferOverflowPatch.txt
   is June 19th, but the Bugtraq post was July 2, and the poster
   said that a patch had not been available yet.  However, the
   poster also said that they had notified Trend on June 11.
   Add that the Action parameter is the one with the overflow.
   
   This patch description only identifies HttpSave.dll, not
   RegGo.dll (as identified by CVE-2001-0678), but it implies
   that multiple DLL's may have been fixed.  Looking at the DLL's
   in the patch, there is RegGo.dll and a number of other DLL's.
   However, this RegGo.dll is different than the one from
   the patch for CVE-2001-0678, so maybe they fixed yet another
   problem here.
   
   That problem might be:
   BUGTRAQ:20010621 TrendMicro InterScan WebManager Version 1.2 RegGo.dll Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/192645
   where the discloser said that the problem was discovered
   in June 6 and implied that Trend Micro would fix the problem,
   so Trend was notified sometime between June 6 and June 21.
   So, the dates might imply that Trend fixed both the
   HTTPSave.dll and this variant (if in fact it's a variant and
   not a rediscovery of CVE-2001-0678) in a single patch.
   If true, then that would argue that this candidate should be 
   merged with the RegGo.dll variant reported in the above
   Bugtraq reference, along with some of the other DLL's - just
   in case someone rediscovers THOSE, too.
   
   Other DLL's in this patch are covered in other posts
   in the same time frame by the same person.

Voter Comments:
 Christey> There is some overlap between CVE-2001-0551 and CVE-2001-0772.
   CVE-2001-0551 describes a specific vulnerability in
   dtprintinfo.  HP acknowledges CVE-2001-0551 by stating
   that the problem is fixed in HP:HPSBUX0105-151, which
   is CVE-2001-0772.  But CVE-2001-0772 is a vague advisory
   that identifies other vulnerabilities (and vulnerability
   types) besides CVE-2001-0551.  Perhaps CVE-2001-0772 should
   be RECAST to "remove" the reference to dtprintinfo and
   leave the other vague descriptions.  CVE-2001-0772 and
   CVE-2001-0551 are very good examples of the problems that
   CVE faces in being consistent with respect to the level of
   abstraction, as documented in the CD:SF-CODEBASE, CD:SF-LOC,
   and CD:VAGUE content decisions.

ValiCert Enterprise Validation Authority (EVA) Administration Server
3.3 through 4.2.1 uses insufficiently random data to (1) generate
session tokens for HSMs using the C rand function, or (2) generate
certificates or keys using /dev/urandom instead of another source
which blocks when the entropy pool is low, which could make it easier
for local or remote attackers to steal tokens or certificates via
brute force guessing.

Voter Comments:
 Christey> According to an email message from the vendor
   (bcoveney@4d.com) on March 13, 2002, this problem is only
   possible if the server admin has already configured the
   server's web root to be at the top-level folder.  This is not
   the default.  As such, any "directory traversal" attack would
   not escape above the folder that has already been specified by
   the admin.  Since this is a generic misconfiguration problem
   for all web servers, and not a default configuration of ACI
   4D, then this candidate should not be included in CVE.
   
   The quote from the vendor is: "By default the 4D WebServer
   doesn't have this behavior. A property has to be turned on to allow
   this (despite our warnings of the consequences). We don't allow pages
   outside of our web folder to be served but if the developer of the
   site wishes they can set the webroot folder to be whatever they
   want. In the system that 'krfinisterre@checkfree.com' evaluated the
   developer had chosen to set their root folder to be the root of the
   computer system (C:\) and therefore all the files on the system were
   available. By default we set the root folder at the same level as the
   database folder so this doesn't happen. You cannot look at any files
   outside the designated WebFolder root tree."

 Baker> I would say that this is a vulnerability, since their website
   touts URL filtering as a feature of the product.  If the product has to
   filter URL's then the product needs to be able to filter URL's properly,
   or the product fails.
   Here is the list of features, quoted from their product page for
   web sweeper:
   
   "Key Features
   Policy based web security implementation for information posted to and downloaded from the web
   Protects against unauthorized users accessing the web utilizing user authentication
   Provides URL filtering blocking stopping inappropriate site access
   Protects against loss of confidential information, viruses, portable code, and inappropriate content entering and
   leaving via web based e-mail accounts such as hotmail and Yahoo
   Auditing and reporting on individual and group web traffic

   This would appear to be a dupe of CVE-2001-0797, but the HP advisory
   from CVE-2001-0797 is too vague to be certain.  As quoted in
   the CERT advisory for CVE-2001-0797, HP says:
   "HP-UX does have a benign buffer overflow... [which] has been
   fixed by HP."  HP:HPSBUX0107-160 (CVE-2001-1182) states that
   "The login(1) command allows restricted shell users to
   circumvent security checks" which could be interpreted as
   meaning that HP has found a slightly less-than-benign aspect
   of the overflow, but since (a) the advisory says nothing about
   overflows and (b) the advisory does not include any
   cross-references, it cannot be clear.  There is a difference
   in the release dates as well, however, since the HP advisory
   was released in July 2001 and this CAN was publicized in
   December 2001, which may be sufficient evidence that the
   problems are different.
   
   This probably is not the same issue in login as CVE-2001-0978,
   since different patches are referenced in that CAN.
   
   There is insufficient information to know whether this is the
   same issue as CVE-2001-0094 (kerberos library issues that
   affect kerberized login).

   The vendor says that "there is no denial of service
   vulnerability" but goes on to describe "a defect related to
   the use of SSL junctions between the WebSEAL component and Web
   Servers. This defect can cause the WebSEAL component to fail if SSL
   junctions are being used, and certain URLs are then passed across

Voter Comments:
 Christey> INCLUSION: The author of the zml.cgi program says that the vulnerable
   version is not his, and that zml.cgi does not take a file parameter.
   If this is an adaptation of that zml.cgi program, and the adaptation
   is not generally available, then it should not be included in CVE.
   Almost all of the hits on Google for "zml.cgi" are references to the
   reported vulnerability, and a search for "zml" doesn't turn up any
   obvious web pages, so it cannot be determined if there is another
   product that happens to use a script named zml.cgi.

Voter Comments:
 Baker> I don't think this is really a vulnerability.  If I am not mistaken,
   those are "services" which have to be managed by the services control
   in windows 2K.  This keeps users from killing things the system has
   to have.  I don't think it is possible to kill another of other services
   in this manner either.  Try it on almost any W2K system, and there are any
   number of services that you cannot kill from the process tab, rather you
   must go to the services controller to stop the service.
   I vote to reject this, as this is not a vulnerability, since you would have
   to be administrator on the system to change one of these services to a trojan
   version anyway.

   REVIEWING(1) Christey

Voter Comments:
 Christey> CALDERA:CSSA-2001-006.0 specifically says they're not
   vulnerable to this issue.  So, do we remove the reference
   (because they aren't affected by this problem), or do we
   keep the reference because it specifically mentions this
   issue?
   
   Need to review the other advisories; they don't necessarily
   have the details to know whether they're addressing this
   problem or not (the overflow mentioned in these refs is
   covered by CVE-2001-1274).  MANDRAKE:MDKSA-2001:014
   clearly identifies this issue.
   
   FREEBSD:FreeBSD-SA-01:16 discussed "remote vulerabilities"
   (plural), which *could* include this issue, but it is not
   absolutely certain.  REDHAT:RHSA-2001:003 refers to
   "information protection issues," but that's not clear enough
   either.
   
   Thanks to John Segura of secureinfo.com for noticing this
   issue.

   - Security problems with pnm
   If the pnm backend is installed and saned is used to allow users on
   remote computers to scan on the local machine, pnm files can be read by
   the remote user. This is limited to the files saned can access (usually
   it's running as user "sane"). All pnm files can be read if saned runs
   as root which isn't recommended anyway. The pnm backend is disabled
   by default. If you want to use it, enable it with configure (see 
   configure --help for details). Be sure that only trusted users can

The SSH-1 protocol allows remote servers to conduct man-in-the-middle

creating a Session ID that matches the Session ID of the target, but
which uses a public key pair that is weaker than the target's public
key, which allows the attacker to compute the corresponding private
key and use the target's Session ID with the compromised key pair to
masquerade as the target.

Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2000 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a flood of
fragmented UDP packets.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, saying
that it requires high bandwidth to exploit, and the server does not
experience any instability.  Therefore this "laws of physics" issue
might not be included in CVE.
