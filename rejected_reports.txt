   router or switch to halt and reload if the IOS HTTP service is enabled,

Voter Comments:
 Frech> XF:qmail-rcpt
 Christey> DUPE CVE-1999-0418 and CVE-1999-0144?
 Christey> Dan Bernstein, author of Qmail, says that this is not a
   vulnerability in qmail because Unix has built-in resource
   limits that can restrict the size of a qmail process; other
   limits can be specified by the administrator.  See
   http://cr.yp.to/qmail/venema.html
   
   Significant discussion of this issue took place on the qmail
   list.  The fundamental question appears to be whether 
   application software should set its own limits, or rely
   on limits set by the parent operating system (in this case,
   UNIX).  Also, some people said that the only problem was that
   the suggested configuration was not well documented, but this
   was refuted by others.
   
   See the following threads at
   http://www.ornl.gov/its/archives/mailing-lists/qmail/1997/06/threads.html

 Christey> CVE-1999-0287 is probably a duplicate of CVE-1999-0467.  In
   NTBUGTRAQ:19990409 Webcom's CGI Guestbook for Win32 web servers
   Mnemonix says that he had previously reported on a similar
   problem.  Let's refer to the NTBugtraq posting as
   CVE-1999-0467.  We will refer to the "previous report" as
   CVE-1999-0287, which could be found at:
   http://oliver.efri.hr/~crv/security/bugs/NT/httpd41.html
   
   0287 describes an exploit via the "template" hidden variable.
   The exploit describes manually editing the HTML form to
   change the filename to read from the template variable.
   
   The exploit as described in 0467 encodes the template variable
   directly into the URL.  However, hidden variables are also
   encoded into the URL, which would have looked the same to
   the web server regardless of the exploit.  Therefore 0287
   and 0467 are the same.

Voter Comments:
 Wall> Invalid ICMP datagram fragments causes a denial of service in Windows 95 and
   Windows NT systems.
   Reference: Q154174.
   Jolt is also known as sPING, ICMP bug, Icenewk, and Ping of Death.
   It is a modified teardrop 2 attack.  
 Frech> XF:nt-ssping
   ADDREF XF:ping-death
   ADDREF XF:teardrop-mod

   is exploiting any different flaw than teardrop does.
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
 Baker> Jolt (original) is basically just a fragmented oversized ICMP that
   kills Win boxes ala Ping of Death.
   Teardrop is altering the offset in fragmented tcp packets so that the
   end of subsequent fragments is inside first packet...
   Teardrop 2 is UDP packets, if I remember right.
   Seems like Jolt (original, not jolt 2) is just exploit code that
   creates a ping of death (CVE 1999-0128)
 Levy> I tend to agree with Baker.
 CHANGE> [Armstrong changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]
 Armstrong> This code does not use fragment overlap.  It is simply a large ICMP echo request.
 Christey> See the SCO advisory at:
   http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/advisory.html?id=1411
   which may further clarify the issue.
 LeBlanc> This is a hodge-podge of DoS attacks. Jolt isn't the same
   thing as ping of death - POD was an oversized ICMP packet, Jolt froze
   Linux and Solaris (and I think not NT), IIRC Jolt2 did get NT boxes.
   Teardrop and teardrop2 were related attacks (usually ICMP frag attacks),
   but each of these is a distinct vulnerability, affected a discrete group
   of systems, and should have distinct CVE numbers. CVE entries should be
   precise as to what the problem is.
 Meunier> I agree with Leblanc in that Jolt is multi-faceted.  Jolt has
   characteristics of Ping of Death AND teardrop, but it doesn't do
   either exactly.  Moreover, it sends a truncated IP fragment.  I
   disagree with Armstrong; jolt uses overlapping fragments.  It's not a
   simple ping of death either.  It may be that the author's intent was
   to construct a "super attack" somehow combining elements of other
   vulnerabilities to try to make it more potent.  In any case it
   succeeded in confusing the CVE board :-).
   
   I notice that Jolt uses echo replies (type 0) instead of echo
   requests (to get past firewalls?).  Jolt is peculiar in that it also
   sends numerous overlapping fragments.  The "Pascal Simulator" :-) says
   it sends:
   
   - 172 fragments of length 400 with offset starting at 5120 and
   increasing by about 47 (odd arithmetic of 5120 OR ((n* 380) >> 3)),
   which eventually results in sending fragments inside an already
   covered area once ((n* 380) >> 3) is greater than 5120, which occurs
   when n is reaches 108.  This would look a bit like TearDrop if
   fragments were reassembled on-the-fly.
   
   - 1 fragment such that the total length of all the fragments
   is greater than 65535 (my calculation is 172*380 + 418 = 65778; the
   comment about 65538 must be wrong).  The last packet is size 418
   according to the IP header but the buffer is of size 400.  The sendto
   takes as argument the size of the buffer so a truncated packet is
   sent.
   
   So, I am not sure if the problem is because the last packet
   doesn't extend to the payload it says it has or because the total size
   of all fragments is greater than 65535.  The author says it may take
   more than one sending, so perhaps this has to do with an incorrect
   error handling and recovery.  One would need to experiment and isolate
   each of those characteristics and test them independently.  Inasmuch
   as each of those things is likely a different vulnerability, then I
   agree with Leblanc that this entry should be split.  I'll try that if
   I ever get bored.  Jolt 2 should also have a different entry (see
   below).
   
   Jolt 2 runs in an infinite loop, sending the same fragmented
   IP packet, which can pretend to be "ICMP" or "UDP" data; however this
   is meaningless, as it's just a late fragment of an IP packet.  The
   attack works only as long as packets are sent.  According to
   http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/62170 the packets are
   truncated, and would overflow over the 65535 byte limit, which is
   similar to Jolt.  Note that Jolt does send that much data whereas
   jolt2 doesn't.  Since jolt2 is simpler and narrower than jolt, and it
   has weaker consequences, I believe that it's a different
   vulnerability.
   
   "Jolt 2 vulnerability causes a temporary denial-of-service in
   Windows-type OSes" would be a title for it.

 Christey> Is CVE-1999-0389 a duplicate of CVE-1999-0798?  CVE-1999-0389
   has January 1999 dates associated with it, while CVE-1999-0798
   was reported in late December.
   
   Also, is this the same line of code as CVE-1999-0914?  Both are in
   the netstd package, it could look like a library problem.
   
   However, deep in the changelog in the
   netstd_3.07-7slink.3.diff on Debian, Herbert Xu includes
   the following entry:
   
   +netstd (3.07-7slink.1) frozen; urgency=high

   whether this is a vulnerability. The system can be configured not to do
   this, and one may argue that SNMP itself is an insecure configuration.
   Furthermore, the share information isn't published via registry keys -
   the description could refer to more than one actual issue. SNMP is meant
   to allow people to obtain information about systems. I'm willing to

   Yes, the impact may be different, but we could have a

Voter Comments:
 Northcutt> (Though I sympathize with this one :)
 CHANGE> [Frech changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]
 Frech> Ping is a utility that can be run on demand; ICMP echo is a
   message 
   type. As currently worded, this candidate seems as if an arbitrary
   host 
   is vulnerable because it is capable of running an arbitrary program
   or
   function (in this case, ping/ICMP echo). There are many
   programs/functions that 
   'shouldn't' be on a computer, from a security admin's perspective.
   Even if this
   were a vulnerability, it would be impacted by CD-HIGHCARD.
 Meunier> Every ICMP message type presents a vulnerability or an
   exposure, if access is not controlled.  By that I mean not only those
   in RFC 792, but also those in RFC 1256, 950, and more.  I think that
   the description should be changed to "ICMP messages are acted upon
   without any access control".  ICMP is an error and debugging protocol.
   We complain about vendors leaving testing backdoors in their programs.
   ICMP is the equivalent for TCP/IP.  ICMP should be in the dog house,
   unless you are trying to troubleshoot something.  MTU discovery is
   just a performance tweak -- it's not necessary.  I don't know of any
   ICMP message type that is necessary if the network is functional.
   Limited logging of ICMP messages could be useful, but acting upon them
   and allowing the modification of routing tables, the behavior of the
   TCP/IP stack, etc... without any form of authentication is just crazy.

   13 and 14 (timestamp request and reply) and 17 and 18 (netmask request

   precise and correct language.  I believe that this is a valid CVE
   entry (it's a common source of vulnerabilities or exposures) even
   though I see that the inferred action was "reject".  Knowing the time
   of a host also allows attacks against random number generators that
   are seeded with the current time.  I want to push to have it accepted.

   CVE-1999-0764: NetBSD allows ARP packets to overwrite static ARP entries.
   Will reconsider if reference provides enough information to render a
   distinction.
 Christey> This particular vulnerability was exploited by an attacker
   during the ID'Net IDS test network exercise at the SANS
   Network Security '99 conference.  The attacker adapted a
   publicly available program that was able to spoof another
   machine on the same physical network.

   that the exploit is different.  I believe there was
   another reason for keeping these distinct, but that
   "deeper analysis" was not recorded :-(  While it's possible
   that this is the same bug from some common version of make,
   in the absence of other information we should probably
   keep these two split.

   And Debian make:
   http://security.debian.org/dists/slink/updates/source/make_3.77-5slink.diff.gz
   
   OK... now that I've hurt my brain looking at the code, while
   there are major differences in the surrounding code,
   ultimately both FreeBSD and Debian create an "outfile" file
   descriptor for the temporary file, within main() in main.c.
   In addition, child_execute_job() in job.c uses an outfile
   variable - for both sources.
   
   Perhaps FreeBSD reported the -j problem without seeing that it
   could come in from stdin as well, and/or Debian/etc. didn't realize
   that it was exploitable from job control, or maybe a combination of
   the two.  Regardless, the two problems are the same.

 Christey> As Andre basically said without naming content decisions,

   HOWEVER - the author of the product says that WindMail isn't
   supposed to be a CGI script, and says that the pipe 
   character problem is not related to Geocel.  So should CVE
   record when someone runs a program that wasn't intended to
   be a CGI?  There may be a level of abstraction issue here.
   Note that Perl and shell interpreters in CGI-BIN are 
   already mentioned in CVE-1999-0509.  If we want to include
   "using a program that wasn't designed to be a CGI" as a
   problem, we should have a separate candidate.

 Christey> Alan DeKok <aland@FREERADIUS.ORG> says it applies to other RADIUS
   programs also, *however* since it needs a valid username, only
   the RADIUS owner can exploit it by changing the config file.  But
   if the config file can be written by others - well, that's still
   a potential risk, but you've probably got bigger problems then.

   Possible confirmation in 0.15: "sql_getvpdata now dynamically
   allocates buffer sizes for sql queries to avoid over runs"
   
   But that's a bit general.
   
   Alan Kok said that Cistron and other RADIUS servers were affected; the
   ICRADIUS changelog says to check the Cistron logs for other possible
   bug fixes, since ICRADIUS uses Cistron codebase.  Go back to
   freeradius.org and find link to Cistron at
   http://www.miquels.cistron.nl/radius/
   
   Cistron changelog at http://www.miquels.cistron.nl/radius/ChangeLog It
   has different version numbers - go back to ICRADIUS changelog to find
   rought equivalents.  ICRADIUS 0.15 uses Cistron 1.6.3 patches, so
   start from there.
   
   No apparent problems in 1.6.3 or 1.6.4, but 1.6.1 says: "Fix all
   strcpy(), strcat(), sprintf() and sccanf() calls for buffer
   overflows."  So perhaps the problem was fixed then?  Or maybe the
   vulnerable sscanf() call was missed and/or disregarded because it was
   believed that the hostname could be trusted since it came from a
   well-controlled configuration file?

 LeBlanc> The poster re-discovered a vulnerability we patched two years

   Microsoft posted a response to BugTraq when this one went
   public, and reminded them that we'd already patched it.
   
   BTW, I think we want to try and pay attention to follow-ups to
   these threads in order to minimize noise in the process.
 Christey> Based on David's comments, this is covered by CVE-1999-0002.
   However, that candidate may wind up being SPLIT, so I will
   keep this one around for the moment.
   
   With respect to watching followups, we are relying quite
   a bit on other data feeds instead of doing our own reviews
   of all the different data sources.  The data feeds may report
   these problems as new before corrections are posted.
   Followups do often lend additional information to the
   candidates, and as is the case with this one, we will
   often catch the discrepancy before the candidate becomes an
   official entry, whether by MITRE's own analysis or by that
   of other Board members.

Voter Comments:

 Christey> The description should make the point that the original files

 LeBlanc> The preconditions needed to obtain the clear-text backup file
   are that the user must be able to read the raw disk. Only administrators
   or those with physical access can read the raw disk. An admin could
   alter the operating system such that anything a user did would be
   available, even EFS information (since the admin can cause processes to
   run as any user who is logged on currently). Thus even if this issue
   were not present, the same set of preconditions would lead to access to
   the same information. In the case of physical access, scrubbing the disk
   should be viewed only as raising the bar - information can be recovered
   even from overwritten sectors. Additionally, coverage of a file might
   not be complete - in the case where a file is truncated, then encrypted,
   there could be sectors with file information that the operating system
   would have no knowledge of at the time the encryption occurred, and
   there is no practical way to wipe these. Considering all the realities
   of the situation, the only real-world solution is to create files you'd
   like encrypted in a directory marked for encryption.

 Baker> I would argue that a browser executing a script when it shouldn't is still a vulnerability.  If it is supposed to be a non-scriptable file type, and that fails, resulting in a script being executed without the user's knowledge, then it is a problem, and thus should be included as a vulnerability.  I vote this should be accepted, and if Microsoft acknowledges this in their follow up, then you have vendor acknowledgement of the problem as well.

Voter Comments:
 Christey> According to an email message from the vendor
   (bcoveney@4d.com) on March 13, 2002, this problem is only
   possible if the server admin has already configured the
   server's web root to be at the top-level folder.  This is not
   the default.  As such, any "directory traversal" attack would
   not escape above the folder that has already been specified by
   the admin.  Since this is a generic misconfiguration problem
   for all web servers, and not a default configuration of ACI
   4D, then this candidate should not be included in CVE.
   
   The quote from the vendor is: "By default the 4D WebServer
   doesn't have this behavior. A property has to be turned on to allow
   this (despite our warnings of the consequences). We don't allow pages
   outside of our web folder to be served but if the developer of the
   site wishes they can set the webroot folder to be whatever they
   want. In the system that 'krfinisterre@checkfree.com' evaluated the
   developer had chosen to set their root folder to be the root of the
   computer system (C:\) and therefore all the files on the system were
   available. By default we set the root folder at the same level as the
   database folder so this doesn't happen. You cannot look at any files
   outside the designated WebFolder root tree."

 Baker> I don't think this is really a vulnerability.  If I am not mistaken,
   those are "services" which have to be managed by the services control
   in windows 2K.  This keeps users from killing things the system has
   to have.  I don't think it is possible to kill another of other services
   in this manner either.  Try it on almost any W2K system, and there are any
   number of services that you cannot kill from the process tab, rather you
   must go to the services controller to stop the service.
   I vote to reject this, as this is not a vulnerability, since you would have
   to be administrator on the system to change one of these services to a trojan
   version anyway.

Information leaks in IIS 4 through 5.1 allow remote attackers to
obtain potentially sensitive information or more easily conduct brute
force attacks via responses from the server in which (2) in certain
configurations, the server IP address is provided as the realm for
Basic authentication, which could reveal real IP addresses that were
obscured by NAT, or (3) when NTLM authentication is used, the NetBIOS
name of the server and its Windows NT domain are revealed in response
to an Authorization request.  NOTE: this entry originally contained a
vector (1) in which the server reveals whether it supports Basic or
NTLM authentication through 401 Access Denied error messages.  CVE has
REJECTED this vector; it is not a vulnerability because the
information is already available through legitimate use, since
authentication cannot proceed without specifying a scheme that is
supported by both the client and the server.

 Baker> I don't believe that a configuration option by the administrator is a
   vulnerability.  The fact that the administrator can require authentication
   of users attempting to use the service, without notifying users that
   are NOT using authentication is not a vulnerability.  For example, I
   could configure sshd to allow only certain hosts to connect, by means of
   a key, and if someone else tried to connect that is not authorized, it
   would disallow it.  Similarly, the administrator could require authentication
   and only notify those users allowed to connect of the necessary authentication
   credentials to preclude un-authorized use of the system.  The only way I would
   see this as a vulnerability was if the change was able to be made without
   the proper credentials through some fault in the program, or if there was no way to enable authentication on
   any client trying to connect which would render the system unusable to everyone
   (but that would still not really be a vulnerability as much as a "stupid
   feature")
   The ability to make this change afer gaining administrator priveleges by means
   of another vulnerability does not make this a vulnerability.  I would classify
   this as a configuration setting that can severly restrict access, at the discretion
   of the administrator.

The (1) CertGetCertificateChain, (2) CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy,
and (3) WinVerifyTrust APIs within the CryptoAPI for Microsoft
products including Microsoft Windows 98 through XP, Office for Mac,
Internet Explorer for Mac, and Outlook Express for Mac, do not
properly verify the Basic Constraints of intermediate CA-signed X.509
certificates, which allows remote attackers to spoof the certificates
of trusted sites via a man-in-the-middle attack for SSL sessions, as
originally reported for Internet Explorer and IIS.

 Williams> insufficient data.
 CHANGE> [Cox changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]
 Cox> Expected behaviour.  By source code analysis the difference in
   behaviour mentioned in the report only occurs when an administrator has
   configured the server with an explicit userlist - either to allow or deny
   all users in the userlist.  The vsftpd manual page states that if a
   userlist is used then the user will be denied access before they are asked
   for a password to help prevent cleartext passwords being transmitted.  
   Administrators who don't want this behaviour do not need to configure an
   optional userlist.

 Christey> MISC:http://www.xlightftpd.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=40
   In the above URL, the vendor says that only one of 3 bugs
   reported in February 2004 were an "actual server bug," and the other 2
   "traced back into windows' dll and they won't happen if windows
   service pack is installed.
   
   The "actual server bug" is CVE-2004-0287.  The demonstration
   for *this* issue shows that the application breaks in comctl32.dll.
   So, this candidate may be erroneous, and an interesting side effect of
   another bug that's not related to xlight at all.
   
   Thus, this candidate may need to be REJECTED.

   REVIEWING(1) Christey

Voter Comments:
 Christey> There is active disagreement regarding whether this satisfies the
   criteria for inclusion in CVE, because the attack vectors require
   function parameters that are typically controlled only by the
   application developer, not an external attacker.  This would mean that
   the PHP application owner could exploit it
   
   Since various PHP functions already allow the application owner to
   execute commands, no additional privileges would be gained by
   exploiting such a bug.  However, if safe_mode is enabled in PHP, then
   the PHP functions related to execution are restricted
   (e.g. shell_exec()).  Thus, exploitation may allow the PHP application
   owner to execute code *despite* the configured restrictions imposed by
   safe mode, which then qualifies this as a vulnerability.

   Since the application developer presumably already has acccess
   to the underlying file system, directory traversal attacks provide no
   additional access to the application owner.  Therefore, this candidate
   would only be valid if there are cases in which the attacker can
   inject a null character into a string that is processed by addslashes.

PHP 4.x to 4.3.9, and PHP 5.x to 5.0.2, when running in safe mode on a
multithreaded Unix webserver, allows local users to bypass
safe_mode_exec_dir restrictions and execute commands outside of the
intended safe_mode_exec_dir via shell metacharacters in the current
directory name.  NOTE: this issue was originally REJECTed by its CNA
before publication, but that decision is in active dispute.  This
candidate may change significantly in the future as a result of
further discussion.

   REVIEWING(1) Christey

Voter Comments:
 Christey> There is active disagreement regarding whether this satisfies the
   criteria for inclusion in CVE, because the attack vectors require
   function parameters that are typically controlled only by the
   application developer, not an external attacker.  This would mean that
   only the PHP application owner could exploit it.
   
   Since various PHP functions already allow the application owner to
   execute commands, no additional privileges would be gained by
   exploiting such a bug.  However, if safe_mode is enabled in PHP, then
   the PHP functions related to execution are restricted
   (e.g. shell_exec()).  Thus, exploitation may allow the PHP application
   owner to execute code *despite* the configured restrictions imposed by
   safe mode, which then qualifies this as a vulnerability.

The safe mode checks in PHP 4.x to 4.3.9 and PHP 5.x to 5.0.2 truncate

** REJECT **

cart.php in LiteCommerce might allow remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information via invalid (1) category_id or (2) product_id
parameters.  NOTE: this issue was originally claimed to be due to SQL
injection, but the original researcher is known to be frequently
inaccurate with respect to bug type and severity.  The vendor has
disputed this issue, saying "These reports are credited to malicious
person we refused to hire. We have not taken legal action against him
only because he is located in India.  The vulnerabilites reported can
not be reproduced, hence information you provide is contrary to fact."
Further investigation by CVE personnel shows that an invalid SQL
syntax error could be generated, but it only reveals portions of
underlying database structure, which is already available in
documentation from the vendor, and it does not appear to lead to path
disclosure.  Therefore, this issue is not a vulnerability or an
exposure, and it probably should be REJECTED.

** UNVERIFIABLE **

NOTE: this issue describes a problem that can not be independently
verified as of 20050421.  Adobe Acrobat reader (AcroRd32.exe) 6.0 and
earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
("Invalid-ID-Handle-Error" error) and modify memory beginning at a
particular address, possibly allowing the execution of arbitrary code,
via a crafted PDF file.  NOTE: the vendor has stated that the reporter
refused to provide sufficient details to confirm the issue.  In
addition, due to the lack of details in the original advisory, an
independent verification is not possible.  Finally, the reliability of
the original reporter is unknown.  This item has only been assigned a
CVE identifier for tracking purposes, and to serve as a concrete
example of the newly defined UNVERIFIABLE and PRERELEASE content
decisions in CVE, which must be discussed by the Editorial Board.
Without additional details or independent verification by reliable
sources, it is highly likely that this item will be REJECTED.

Cisco IOS 12.0 to 12.4 might allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a heap-based buffer overflow in system timers.
NOTE: this issue does not correspond to a specific vulnerability,
rather a general weakness that only increases the feasibility of
exploitation of any vulnerabilities that might exist.  Such
design-level weaknesses normally are not included in CVE, so perhaps
this issue should be REJECTed.

** DISPUTED **

SQL injection vulnerability in server_privileges.php in phpMyAdmin
2.7.0 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL
commands via the (1) dbname and (2) checkprivs parameters.  NOTE: the
vendor and a third party have disputed this issue, saying that the
main task of the program is to support query execution by
authenticated users, and no external attack scenario exists without an
auto-login configuration.  Thus it is likely that this issue will be
REJECTED.  However, a closely related CSRF issue has been assigned
CVE-2005-4450.

** DISPUTED **

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Fidra Lighthouse CMS 1.1.0
and earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via the search parameter in a query_string to the home page.
NOTE: The vendor disputes this issue, saying "Lighthouse does not in
any way make use of the PHP technology.  [It] is an application server
... A technology like this cannot be susceptible to client-side
cross-site-scripting-attacks on its own, but only applications created
based on such a technology. This does not only apply to Lighthouse,
but also to Perl, PHP or web applications based on Java Servlet
technology."  Since the original researcher is known to test demo
pages and is sometimes inaccurate, it is likely that this issue will
be REJECTED.

Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 6.2 does not
properly count the number of named capturing subpatterns, which allows
context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a
regular expression with a large number of named subpatterns, which
triggers a buffer overflow.  NOTE: this issue was originally subsumed
by CVE-2006-7224, but that CVE has been REJECTED and split.

Generator (flex) before 2.5.33 does not allocate enough memory for
grammars containing (1) REJECT statements or (2) trailing context
rules, which causes flex to generate code that contains a buffer

Integer overflow in Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library
before 6.7 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary
code via a regular expression containing a large number of named
subpatterns (name_count) or long subpattern names (max_name_size),
which triggers a buffer overflow.  NOTE: this issue was originally
subsumed by CVE-2006-7224, but that CVE has been REJECTED and split.

Integer overflow in Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library
before 6.7 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a regular expression that involves large (1) min,
(2) max, or (3) duplength values that cause an incorrect length
calculation and trigger a buffer overflow, a different vulnerability
than CVE-2006-7227.  NOTE: this issue was originally subsumed by
CVE-2006-7224, but that CVE has been REJECTED and split.

** REJECT **

The getlock function in aimage/aimage.cpp in AFFLIB 2.2.8 and earlier
allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack
on temporary lock files (aka "time-of-check-time-of-use file race").
NOTE: the researcher has retracted the original advisory, stating that
"the portion of vulnerable code is not called in any current version
of AFFLIB and is therefore not exploitable."

The MS-RPC functionality in smbd in Samba 3 on SUSE Linux before
20070720 does not include "one character in the shell escape
handling."  NOTE: this issue was originally characterized as a shell
metacharacter issue due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-2447, which
was interpreted by CVE to be security relevant.  However, SUSE and Red
Hat have disputed the problem, stating that the only impact is that
scripts will not be executed if they have a "c" in their name, but
even this limitation might not exist.  This does not have security
implications, so should not be included in CVE.

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in Cisco IOS 12.x and IOS XR
allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated via the
"Bind Shell", "Reverse Shell", and "Two byte rootshell (Tiny Shell)"
attacks.  NOTE: the vendor and researcher agree that this issue does
not cross privilege boundaries, saying they do not "represent a
vulnerability."  The disclosure was intended to demonstrate techniques
for exploitation, which is not covered by CVE.

Reference: MLIST:[linux-kernel] 20071108 [PATCH] time: fix sysfs_show_{available,current}_clocksources() buffer overflow problem
Reference: URL:http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119451922608530&w=2

** REJECT **

Buffer overflow in the (1) sysfs_show_available_clocksources and (2)
sysfs_show_current_clocksources functions in Linux kernel 2.6.23 and
earlier might allow local users to cause a denial of service or
execute arbitrary code via crafted clock source names.  NOTE:
follow-on analysis by Linux developers states that "There is no way
for unprivileged users (or really even the root user) to add new
clocksources."

The NIST SP 800-90A default statement of the Dual Elliptic Curve
Deterministic Random Bit Generation (Dual_EC_DRBG) algorithm contains
point Q constants with a possible relationship to certain "skeleton
key" values, which might allow context-dependent attackers to defeat
cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of those
values.  NOTE: this is a preliminary CVE for Dual_EC_DRBG; future
research may provide additional details about point Q and associated
attacks, and could potentially lead to a RECAST or REJECT of this CVE.

no actionable details and was disclosed by a person of unknown

known reliability have confirmed the original claim.  The vendor has
not indicated that they are aware of any vulnerability.  Since the
claim has no actionable details or independent verification, it is

** REJECT **

DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: None.  Reason: this
candidate is not a security issue.  It was originally created based on
one vendor's misinterpretation of an upstream changelog comment that
referred to a race condition in the winbind daemon (aka winbindd) in
Samba before 3.0.32.  The upstream vendor states: "The Samba Team sees
no way to exploit this race condition by a user of the system or an
external attacker. In order to be able to trigger the race condition a
privileged user (root) need to intentionally kill a winbind child
process and carefully time the killing to trigger the race
condition. Although, if the user is already privileged, it can more
easily just kill the parent process directly."  CVE concurs with the
dispute.  Notes: CVE users should not use this identifier.

** REJECT **

gmetad in Ganglia 3.1.1, when supporting multiple requests per
connection on an interactive port, allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service via a request to the gmetad service with a path that
does not exist, which causes Ganglia to (1) perform excessive CPU
computation and (2) send the entire tree, which consumes network
bandwidth.  NOTE: the vendor and original researcher have disputed
this issue, since legitimate requests can generate the same amount of
resource consumption.  CVE concurs with the dispute, so this
identifier should not be used.

** REJECT **

Format string vulnerability in the University of Washington (UW)
c-client library, as used by the UW IMAP toolkit imap-2007d and other
applications, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
format string specifiers in the initial request to the IMAP port
(143/tcp).  NOTE: Red Hat has disputed the vulnerability, stating "The
Red Hat Security Response Team have been unable to confirm the
existence of this format string vulnerability in the toolkit, and the
sample published exploit is not complete or functional."  CVE agrees
that the exploit contains syntax errors and uses Unix-only include
files while invoking Windows functions.

The icmp_send function in net/ipv4/icmp.c in the Linux kernel before
2.6.25, when configured as a router with a REJECT route, does not
properly manage the Protocol Independent Destination Cache (aka DST)
in some situations involving transmission of an ICMP Host Unreachable
message, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(connectivity outage) by sending a large series of packets to many
destination IP addresses within this REJECT route, related to an
"rt_cache leak."

libxml2 through 2.9.1 does not properly handle external entities
expansion unless an application developer uses the
xmlSAX2ResolveEntity or xmlSetExternalEntityLoader function, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource
consumption), send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or read
arbitrary files via a crafted XML document, aka an XML External Entity
(XXE) issue.  NOTE: it could be argued that because libxml2 already
provides the ability to disable external entity expansion, the
responsibility for resolving this issue lies with application
developers; according to this argument, this entry should be REJECTed
and each affected application would need its own CVE.
